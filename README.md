# miniDetector
downDetector but scaled down to terminal. So *kawaiiii*, right?
miniDetector is a CLI application that allows you to check whether websites, databases, and services are currently online or unavailable, without having to search each one up individually.
Chosen data is then saved into a `.txt` file, and saved so that on the next start-up, your list of sites remains intact. 


## Goal
The goal is to create a scaled-down version of DownDetector in order to practice techniques that can be applied to the future project, without having to worry about UI elements.
